# Data Structure Experiments
Experimenting with and implementing some common data structures, with various implementations

# Progress
Structures included:
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues based on linked lists
- Stacks & Queues based on arrays and circular arrays
- A simple AVL Binary Tree

# Background
I am using this repo as a practice space to implement some data structures, updating as I learn new data structures in class, as a way to consolidate my learning.
